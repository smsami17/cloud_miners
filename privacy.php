              information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers
              located outside of Your state, province, country or other
              governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may
              differ than those from Your jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of
              such information represents Your agreement to that transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure
              that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this
              Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take
              place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate
              controls in place including the security of Your data and other
              personal information.

              different Privacy Policy.
            </p>

              Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to
              disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in
              response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or
              a government agency).
            </p>
            <h4>Other legal requirements</h4>

              The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.

              If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent’s consent before We collect and use that information.
